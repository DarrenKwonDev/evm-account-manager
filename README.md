## EVM wallet manager

Register/generate multi-chain wallets, label & tag management,   
scheduled Telegram notifications, CEX-based PnL tracking  


### why?

`I'm too lazy`   
and browser/mobile wallets are way too cluttered for managing multiple accounts.  
The UI gets in my way when I'm trying to farm airdrops across dozens of wallets.  
It's mentally exhausting.  
I'm building this tool to stop being lazy and actually make money from airdrops - not just from development and trading.
